            In physics, mathematics, and related fields, a wave is a propagating dynamic disturbance (change from
            equilibrium) of one or more quantities, sometimes as described by a wave equation. In physical waves, at
            least two field quantities in the wave medium are
            involved. Waves can be periodic, in which case those quantities oscillate repeatedly about an equilibrium
            (resting) value at some frequency. When the entire waveform moves in one direction it is said to be a
            traveling wave; by contrast, a pair of superimposed
            periodic waves traveling in opposite directions makes a standing wave. In a standing wave, the amplitude of
            vibration has nulls at some positions where the wave amplitude appears smaller or even zero.

            The types of waves most commonly studied in classical physics are mechanical and electromagnetic. In a
            mechanical wave, stress and strain fields oscillate about a mechanical equilibrium. A mechanical wave is a
            local deformation (strain) in some physical medium
            that propagates from particle to particle by creating local stresses that cause strain in neighboring
            particles too. For example, sound waves are variations of the local pressure and particle motion that
            propagate through the medium. Other examples of mechanical
            waves are seismic waves, gravity waves, surface waves, string vibrations (standing waves), and
            vortices[dubious – discuss]. In an electromagnetic wave (such as light), coupling between the electric and
            magnetic fields which sustains propagation of a wave
            involving these fields according to Maxwell's equations. Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum
            and through some dielectric media (at wavelengths where they are considered transparent). Electromagnetic
            waves, according to their frequencies (or
            wavelengths) have more specific designations including radio waves, infrared radiation, terahertz waves,
            visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.

            Other types of waves include gravitational waves, which are disturbances in spacetime that propagate
            according to general relativity; heat diffusion waves[dubious – discuss]; plasma waves that combine
            mechanical deformations and electromagnetic fields; reaction– diffusion waves, such as in the
            Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction; and many more.</p>
